# TokenCore - The Modular Hardcore Addon

**TokenCore** transforms your World of Warcraft Classic journey into a roguelike survival challenge. Manage your "Life Tokens", beat timers, obey strict equipment rules, or suffer the consequences.

## 💀 How it works
You start with a set amount of **Life Tokens**.
* **Die?** You lose a token.
* **Zero Tokens?** Game Over. Your run is ended (Simulated Permadeath).
* **Want more?** Earn tokens back by completing custom Achievements (Dungeons, Rare Kills, Challenges).

## 🚀 Game Modes
TokenCore offers multiple ways to suffer. Choose your destiny in the Setup Wizard:

### 1. Adrenaline Mode ⏳
**Time is your enemy.**
* You have a countdown timer (e.g., 10 minutes).
* If the timer hits 0: **You lose a Token.**
* **Regain Time:** Kill enemies to extend your life.

### 2. Cursed Mode 🩸
**The weight of the world crushes you.**
* Every **10 Levels**, you automatically lose a Token.
* You must actively hunt Bosses and complete Achievements to stockpile lives before the Curse strikes.

### 3. Peasant Mode 🧑‍🌾
**Know your place.**
* You are forbidden from equipping powerful items.
* **The Rule:** If you equip an item quality higher than your limit (e.g., Green/Uncommon), you are punished immediately.
* Configurable: Play as a true "Grey/White only" Peasant or allow Greens but no Blues.

### 4. Custom Mode ⚙️
Mix and match! Enable the Timer, Level Decay, and Peasant rules simultaneously for the ultimate nightmare.

## 🏆 Achievements & Rewards
Press the **Minimap Button** or type `/tca` to open the Achievement Journal.
* **Targets:** Hunt specific Elite mobs (e.g., Hogger, Vagash).
* **Dungeons:** Kill dungeon bosses.
* **Slayer:** Kill X amount of creatures (Must be your level or higher!).
* **Challenges:** Reach Level 10/20/30 without dying.

*Depending on your settings, completing these may restore a lost Life Token.*

## 📦 Installation
1.  Download the latest release.
2.  Unzip into `World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns/`.
3.  Launch WoW.
4.  Follow the Setup Wizard on your first login.

## ⚖️ Rules
* **Slayer Rules:** Only enemies equal to or higher than your level count towards Slayer achievements.
* **Game Over:** Once you hit 0 Tokens, the HUD turns red. The run is over. Delete the character (or reset the addon to cheat, you coward).
